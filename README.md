This project is an implementation of the analysis and modeling pipeline for the competitive data science project conducted as part of the **Datavidia 2025** competition, specifically titled **"Prediksi Peningkatan Suhu - Warm Up Datavidia 9"**

Forecasting temperature rise using machine learning regression models. This project aims to predict future temperature changes based on historical emissions and climate-related variables.

## Business Understanding

Global warming and climate change are pressing issues. By accurately forecasting temperature rise, governments and organizations can:

- Make better environmental policies.
- Understand the long-term impact of emission sectors.
- Optimize intervention strategies across agriculture, industry, energy, etc.

The goal of this project is to create a robust predictive model that estimates **temperature rise (in °C)** based on multi-sector emissions data using regression techniques.

## Data Overview

The agri-food CO₂ emissions dataset combines and preprocesses data from reputable sources such as the FAO and IPCC to enable structured analysis and forecasting of carbon emissions within the food system. Representing around 62% of global annual CO₂ emissions, the agri-food sector—encompassing food production, processing, and distribution—plays a pivotal role in global warming and climate change mitigation. This dataset offers valuable insights to inform policies and technologies aimed at reducing the sector’s carbon footprint and advancing sustainability in global food systems.
